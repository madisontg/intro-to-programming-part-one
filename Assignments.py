# assignment 3 will execute for ever my_var value that is even and less than or equal to 10
# assignment 4 will execute for ever my_var value that is even and greater than 10
# I ran a test in python and the results were:
##1:Assignment 1
##2:Assignment 3
##3:Assignment 2
##4:Assignment 3
##5:Assignment 1
##6:Assignment 3
##7:Assignment 1
##8:Assignment 3
