# Purpose: take input and cast as different types

# Take input

name = input("Hello, my name is Python.  What's yours?")

# Transform into string, integer, and floating-point value
string_input = name
int_input = int(name)
floating_point_input = float(name)

# Print string, integer, and floating-point values (and crash)
print(string_input)
print(int_input)
print(floating_point_input)
